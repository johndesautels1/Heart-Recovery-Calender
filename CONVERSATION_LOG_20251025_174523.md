**Session ID:** CONV-20251025-174523
**Date:** October 25, 2025

**Branch:** master

## Session Overview

Implemented comprehensive food diary functionality based on therapist requirements for daily meal tracking. Added beverages category with common drinks, created Food Diary page with daily meal organization, and implemented "Copy to Another Day" functionality.

## User Requirements

User's wife provided inspiration from her therapist's requirements:
1. Daily Food Diary Tracking - therapist asks patients to keep detailed food diary of breakfast, lunch, dinner, fluids, and snacks throughout the day
2. Beverages/Drinks Expansion - add various types of drinks as separate cards (milk, orange juice, beer, etc.)
3. Diary Subtab - dedicated page where patients can view their complete daily food intake
4. Calendar Integration - enable clicking on calendar dates to view and add food items
5. Copy Diary to Calendar - feature to copy an entire day's meals to another date with a single button click
6. Git Management - ensure every change is committed to git and pushed to remote

## Features Implemented

### 1. Food Diary Page (`frontend/src/pages/FoodDiaryPage.tsx`)
- Complete daily meal tracking page with 332 lines of React/TypeScript code
- Date navigation with previous/next day buttons and date picker
- Daily nutrition totals display (calories, protein, carbs, fat, sodium)
- Organized meal sections: Breakfast 🍳, Lunch 🥗, Dinner 🍽️, Snacks 🍿
- Individual meal display with timestamps and nutrition breakdown
- "Within Goals" / "Over Limit" indicators for each meal

### 2. Copy to Another Day Functionality
- Dialog for selecting target date
- Copies all meals from selected day to target date
- Preserves meal times while changing dates
- Adds note indicating source date: "Copied from [date]"
- Success confirmation with meal count

### 3. Beverages Category (`backend/scripts/add-beverages.js`)
- Database population script for beverages category

- Configured routing in App.tsx for /food-diary path
- Exported FoodDiaryPage from pages/index.ts

## Files Modified (29 files)

## Bug Fixes

1. **Next Day Button Going Backwards**
   - Location: `frontend/src/pages/FoodDiaryPage.tsx:40`
   - Issue: handleNextDay() used `date.getDate() - 1` instead of `+ 1`
   - Fix: Changed to `date.setDate(date.getDate() + 1)`

2. **NUL File Blocking Git**
   - Issue: Windows NUL device file created in backend directory
   - Fix: Added `NUL` and `**/NUL` to .gitignore

## Code Highlights

### Daily Nutrition Totals Calculation
```typescript
const getTotalNutrition = () => {
  return meals.reduce((totals, meal) => ({
    calories: (totals.calories || 0) + (meal.calories || 0),
    sodium: (totals.sodium || 0) + (meal.sodium || 0),
    protein: (totals.protein || 0) + (meal.protein || 0),
    carbs: (totals.carbohydrates || 0) + (meal.carbohydrates || 0),
    fat: (totals.totalFat || 0) + (meal.totalFat || 0),
  }), { calories: 0, sodium: 0, protein: 0, carbs: 0, fat: 0 });
};
```

### Copy Meals to Another Day
```typescript
const handleCopyToDay = async () => {
  if (!copyToDate || meals.length === 0) return;
  try {
    setLoading(true);
    for (const meal of meals) {
      const mealTime = new Date(meal.timestamp).toTimeString().split(' ')[0];
      const newTimestamp = `${copyToDate}T${mealTime}`;
      await api.createMeal({
        timestamp: newTimestamp,
        mealType: meal.mealType,
        foodItems: meal.foodItems,
        // ... all nutrition fields copied
        notes: meal.notes ? `${meal.notes} (Copied from ${selectedDate})` : `Copied from ${selectedDate}`,
      });
    }
    alert(`Successfully copied ${meals.length} meal(s) to ${copyToDate}!`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error copying meals:', error);
    alert('Failed to copy meals: ' + error.message);
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
};
```
