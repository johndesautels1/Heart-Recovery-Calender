# HEART RECOVERY THERAPY CALENDAR - DETAILED REQUIREMENTS FOR CLAUDE OPUS

## üéØ PRIMARY FOCUS: PATIENT-THERAPIST RELATIONSHIP

This is NOT a general health tracking app. This is a **specialized therapy calendar** focused on:
- Physical therapy progression during cardiac recovery
- Patient-therapist communication and data sharing
- Progressive rehabilitation routines
- Real-world activity reintegration
- Medical provider oversight and alerts

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WHAT'S ALREADY DONE (DON'T REBUILD)

- ‚úÖ Backend API (PostgreSQL + Express + TypeScript)
- ‚úÖ Basic glassmorphic frontend with Tailwind CSS
- ‚úÖ Login/Register/Authentication
- ‚úÖ Basic pages: Dashboard, Calendar, Meals, Medications
- ‚úÖ UI components: GlassCard, Button, Input, Modal, Select

**Repository**: https://github.com/johndesautels1/Heart-Recovery-Calender.git
**Local**: C:\Users\broke\OneDrive\Apps\Heart-Recovery-Calendar\

---

## üé® DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

### Color Scheme: Dark Cobalt Blue
**Match the design from Heart-Recovery-Pro-Clean and Heartbeat apps**

Update Tailwind theme to use dark cobalt blue:
```typescript
// frontend/tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        // Primary: Dark Cobalt Blue theme
        primary: {
          50: '#e3f2fd',
          100: '#bbdefb',
          200: '#90caf9',
          300: '#64b5f6',
          400: '#42a5f5',
          500: '#1e3a8a', // Dark cobalt blue base
          600: '#1e40af',
          700: '#1d4ed8',
          800: '#1e3a8a',
          900: '#0f172a',
        },
        // Activity status colors
        activity: {
          accomplished: '#10b981', // Green
          caution: '#fbbf24',      // Yellow
          notToDo: '#ef4444',      // Red
        },
        // Glass morphism overlay
        glass: 'rgba(30, 58, 138, 0.1)', // Cobalt blue tinted glass
      },
      backgroundImage: {
        'gradient-cobalt': 'linear-gradient(135deg, #1e3a8a 0%, #0f172a 100%)',
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Apply dark cobalt gradient to main layout background.

## üö´ DE-PRIORITIZE VITALS

**DO NOT focus on vitals tracking** - The user already has:
- Advanced vitals display page in Heart-Recovery-Pro-Clean
- High-end glassmorphic dashboard with charts (like Airbus A380)
- Advanced analytics page

**Keep the Vitals page minimal** - just basic logging capability for reference, not the primary focus.

---

## üìä ANALYTICS: THERAPIST-SPECIFIC CHARTS

### What to Build:

#### 1. Therapist Dashboard Charts
Focus on **therapy progression metrics**, NOT general vitals:

**Physical Therapy Compliance:**
- Weekly completion rate of prescribed routines
- Heatmap: Which routines were completed on which days
- Progress bar: Current week in recovery cycle
- Comparison chart: Prescribed vs Actual routines completed

**Activity Reintegration Progress:**
- Timeline view: When patient achieved daily living milestones
  - First shower alone
  - First stair climb
  - First laundry
  - First park walk
- Color-coded progress ladder (green = mastered, yellow = attempted with caution, red = issue occurred)

**Patient Targets & Goals:**
- Goal cards: "Walk 15 minutes by Week 4" (with progress %)
- Weekly targets set by therapist
- Patient achievement badges
- Milestone celebrations

**Issue & Alert Dashboard:**
- Red flag alerts: Missed medications
- Yellow caution: Activities done with issues
- Timeline of incidents with date/time/activity
- Filter by severity

#### 2. Patient View of Same Charts
Patients see simplified versions of therapist charts:
- Their own progress
- Upcoming goals
- Achievements unlocked
- What therapist prescribed vs what they completed

---

## üîó CROSS-APP DATA INTEGRATION

### Requirements:

All three apps need to share data:
1. **Heart-Recovery-Pro-Clean** (main application)
2. **Heartbeat** (master application with physician tab)
3. **This Therapy Calendar**

### Integration Approach:

**Option 1: Shared Database (Recommended)**
- All apps connect to same PostgreSQL database
- Different tables/schemas for different app features
- Use database views for cross-app queries
- Real-time updates via PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY

**Option 2: Microservices with API Gateway**
- Each app is separate microservice
- API Gateway routes requests
- Apps call each other's APIs
- Event bus (Redis Pub/Sub) for real-time updates

**Option 3: Monorepo with Shared Backend**
- Single backend serving all three frontends
- Shared models, services, controllers
- Different frontend routes for each app
- Session sharing across apps

### Data to Share:

**From Heartbeat Physician Tab ‚Üí Therapy Calendar:**
- Medications prescribed
- Lab results
- Doctor's notes
- Medical alerts

**From Therapy Calendar ‚Üí Heart-Recovery-Pro-Clean:**
- Physical therapy progress
- Activity completion
- Telehealth session notes
- Diet logs

**From Heart-Recovery-Pro-Clean ‚Üí Therapy Calendar:**
- Advanced vitals data
- Analytics charts
- Patient health trends

### Implementation:

**Shared API Endpoints:**
```typescript
// backend/src/routes/integration.ts (NEW)

// Get medications from Heartbeat
GET /api/integration/medications/:userId

// Sync therapy progress to Heart-Recovery-Pro
POST /api/integration/sync-therapy-progress

// Get vitals from Heart-Recovery-Pro
GET /api/integration/vitals/:userId

// Webhook endpoints for real-time updates
POST /api/integration/webhooks/medication-updated
POST /api/integration/webhooks/vitals-updated
```

**Frontend Integration:**
```typescript
// frontend/src/services/integration.ts (NEW)

export const integrationAPI = {
  // Get medications from Heartbeat app
  getMedicationsFromHeartbeat: (userId) =>
    api.get(`integration/medications/${userId}`),

  // Send therapy data to Heart-Recovery-Pro
  syncTherapyProgress: (data) =>
    api.post('integration/sync-therapy-progress', data),

  // Get vitals from Heart-Recovery-Pro
  getVitalsFromHeartRecoveryPro: (userId) =>
    api.get(`integration/vitals/${userId}`),
};
